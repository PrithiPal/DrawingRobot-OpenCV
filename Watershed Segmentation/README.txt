Instructions:

1. MORPHED IMAGE : First do the correct morphology for the image for watershed segmentation. App tools can be used for that.
	SPECS : 2D (imbinarize on MORPHED is performed) 
2. COLORED_IMAGE : Actual RGB image (3D)


3. In man_ws, set the appropriate MORPHED_IMAGE and COLORED_IMAGE and it will produce six graphs .
